## Stuff ##
Meloncraft for Minecraft 1.6.4.  Not all features are back yet.

## Installing ##
Add cliffracerx folder and assets folder into your MCP's src/minecraft.  Make sure you have forge!

## Credits ##
Mojang: Some reused Vanilla Minecraft code is in MelonCraft.
Crux_f from the coconut legion on youtube: Friend of mine, did 99% of the textures here.
Jimmy04Creeper: I used some of his dimension tutorial code: https://github.com/Jimmy04Creeper/Tutorial-GutHub
There's probably more I'm forgetting.

## License ##
I'm not sure there's any good license for MelonCraft, so basically:
Fork and poke and prod the project all you want, I'd just like credit.  Use in your modpacks if you want, as that would be awesome!  Do tell me if you use MelonCraft in your modpack, I'd love to come play it.
If you do use something from the project, give credit.  DON'T reupload and call it your own, as that's not cool.  =(
